OBJECT_NOT_KNOWN The parameter has a value that is not known to the server.
INVALID_CALLING_DEVICE The calling device is not valid.
INVALID_CALLED_DEVICE The called device is not valid.
PRIVILEGE_VIOLATION_ON_SPECIFIED_DEVICE The request cannot be provided because the specified device is not authorized for the Service.
INVALID_FORWARDING_DESTINATION The request cannot be provided because the forwarding destination device is not valid. 
PRIVILEGE_VIOLATION_ON_CALLED_DEVICE The request cannot be provided because the called device is not authorized for the Service.
PRIVILEGE_VIOLATION_ON_CALLING_DEVICE The request cannot be provided because the calling device is not authorized for the Service.
INVALID_CSTA_CALL_IDENTIFIER The call identifier is not valid.
INVALID_CSTA_DEVICE_IDENTIFIER The Device Identifier is not valid.
INVALID_CSTA_CONNECTION_IDENTIFIER The Connection identifier is not valid.
INVALID_DESTINATION The Service Request specified a destination that is not valid.
INVALID_FEATURE The Service Request specified a feature that is not valid.

INVALID_CONNECTION_ID_FOR_ACTIVE_CALL The Connection identifier specified in the Active Call parameter of the request is not in the correct state.
NO_ACTIVE_CALL The requested Service operates on an active call, but there is no active call.
NO_HELD_CALL The requested Service operates on a held call, but the specified call is not in the Held state.
NO_CALL_TO_CLEAR There is no call associated with the CSTA Connection identifier of the Clear Call request.
NO_CONNECTION_TO_CLEAR There is no Connection for the CSTA Connection identifier specified as Connection To Be Cleared.
NO_CALL_TO_ANSWER There is no call active for the CSTA Connection identifier specified as Call To Be Answered.
NO_CALL_TO_COMPLETE There is no call active for the CSTA Connection identifier specified as Call To Be Completed.

RESOURCE_BUSY An internal resource is busy. There is high probability that the Service will succeed if retried.
RESOURCE_OUT_OF_SERVICE The Service requires a resource that is Out Of Service. A Service Request that encounters this condition could initiate system problem determination actions (e.g. notification of the network administrator).
